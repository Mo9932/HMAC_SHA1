# 🔐 Authenticated AXI-Stream AI Accelerator
### Secure FIFO Chains with HMAC-SHA1 Authentication

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a secure AXI4-Stream–based accelerator subsystem protected by authenticated FIFO chains.  
A hardware HMAC-SHA1 core is integrated to ensure data integrity and authenticity before data enters the AI computation pipeline.

The design follows an industry-style IP-based hardware architecture similar to modern secure SoC and AI accelerator designs.

## 🏗️ Top-Level Architecture

AXI-Stream Input  
→ Secure FIFO Chain  
→ HMAC-SHA1 Authentication Block  
→ AI Accelerator Kernel (MAC Engine)  
→ AXI-Stream Output  

---

## 🔑 Authentication Details
- Algorithm: HMAC-SHA1
- Tag size: 160 bits
- Authentication granularity: Per packet / frame
- Invalid authentication results in packet drop and error signaling

---

## ✅ Verification
The HMAC-SHA1 implementation was verified against a trusted online reference tool:

https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha1.html

Test vectors used in simulation were cross-checked with the outputs generated by this website to ensure correct padding and hash computation.

## 🧪 Simulation
- RTL simulation using ModelSim / Questa
- AXI-Stream handshake verification
- FIFO behavior and backpressure testing
- FSM debug and waveform inspection
- Automated simulation using DO scripts
